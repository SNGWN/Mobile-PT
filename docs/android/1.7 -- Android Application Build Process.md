# Steps involved in creating android application :-:
   1. Write application in Java/Kotlin language. Ex:. You are using Java as your language.

   2. Java Compiler will Compile that code into Bytecode, which can be effectively executed on normal powered Systems. But just because, on mobile device we have limited resources.

   3. That Byte code will be translated into ***Dalvik Executable bytecode***

   4. Then all the classes will be combined into a single .dex file.
      :-: That Bytecode will be Executed by DVM (Dalvik Virtual Machine) or ART (Android Runtime).
      :-: After First Execution of .dex file it will be optimized for that specific device, and converted into ***.ODEX (optimized DEX)*** file.

   5. At last your Builder will create an archive of all the files in Android Application like
      :-: .dex files
      :-: AndroidManifest.xml
      :-: Assets
      :-: resources
      :-: Libraries
      :-: Digital Certificate
   and gives you an APK file.

# One more thing to understand before Installing That Application in Your Mobile Device. Your app builder will sign your application with Debug Certificate generated by your app builder itself, but if you want to Publish that application on App Stores, you need to sign that application with your Valid Digital Certificate.
# By Signing your application with your valid Digital Certificate you accept the Authority for the that application.
